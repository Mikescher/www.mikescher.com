A while ago a friend and I developed a game for school. It was a Towerdefence game and i think it was pretty nice.  
The problem was that we developed it in Greenfoot - and we reached pretty fast the limitations of this framework.

So after all that I decided to rewrite it completely new in my own game-framework [absCanvas](/programs/view/absCanvas).  
Infinity Tournament is a futuristic themed Towerdefence with an endless amount of waves that get hader with every round.

It has some cool features like:

- endless gameplay
- online competitive highscore
- multiple pre-made maps
- a custom map-editor
- futuristic-neon theme and free electro music
- 3 different tower with multiple diferent upgrade stages

Let's see how high *you* can get in the highscore
