Wikipedia - The Game (*short:* WTG) is a game with an kinda interestic game principle (I heard that idea multiple times from different sources and thought I would try implementing it):

The program  will give you two wikipedia pages, one from where you start and your target. Your goal is then to navigate to the target via Hyperlinks over as few as possible other pages.  
There are different difficulties where you can choose the length of the optimal path (eg. 4 pages optimal).
