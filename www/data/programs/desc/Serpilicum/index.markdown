A little Snake that [Armin Benz](http://sam-dev.de/) and I programmed in our second informatik semester.  
Even though it looks like a console application, it is - in fact - an OpenGL window. You will notice this later when a few effects start to kick in :)

There is a local Highscore and multiple gamemodes.  
Be aware that this was our first real C++ project, and so there *might* be many bugs, and the sourcecode looks **really** horrible ...
