Beepster is a - relatively stupid - little tool to create a really high pitched sound with your computer.

The special trick is that the beep is not created by you normal speakers, but by your internal ones.  
So the only requirement is that you computer has an internal speaker (its the one that creates the error beeps, for example when booting up fails)
