You probably know that a lot of (old) Keygans had neat little animations and background music. There are even whole [sites](http://www.keygenmusic.net/) determined to collect these catchy tunes.

Also a while ago I found in one of these programs (that I use only for the music...) a funny little dancing animation, and just for fun i extracted it.  
So now i thought i would combine them together to create this program that show a dancing character and plays a few Keygen sounds in the background.
