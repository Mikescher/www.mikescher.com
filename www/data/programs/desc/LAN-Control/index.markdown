LAN Control is a tool to execute operations on another computer over a LAN connection.  
All you have to do is execute the `server.exe` on the remote computer and the `client.exe` on yours.
After that you can do things like lock the PC, get executed programs, kill processes etc.

I strongely advice to do this only one your own computer and not control other pc's. Except - you know - you have good reasons :).
