jCircuits is a logic circuits simulation.

It allows you to create and wire your own circuits and then observe how they behave.
Beside all basic gatters there are also more advanced elements and a few premade examples.

A special feature is the 3D mode, to see your circuit layout on a 3D surface.
And the simplistic graphic for each component.
