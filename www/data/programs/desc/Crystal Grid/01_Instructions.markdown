###CrystalGrid Instructions

You start with one ore more of your own cannon type.  
This cannon will immediately start shooting, you can change the direction by draggging the cannon.

Your own cannon is green, neutral cannons (that don't belong to any player) are gray and enemy cannons have their respective team color (red for a single computer enemy).

Every cannon has a regenerating health meter, only if a cannon has full health it will shoot. Shoot at other cannons to decrease their life if they are enemies, or increase their life if they are on your side.

A zero health cannon becomes neutral once again, so you can assimilate a enemy cannon by first decreasing their *(enemy)* health to zero and then increasing *(your own)* health back to full.

You can eliminate enemy bullets by shooting at them, they will destroy each other.

You can "charge" your won cannons by shooting at them, their shooting speed will increase with every cannon feeding into them.

You win the game when you assimilate the last active enemy cannon.  
You loose the game when you loose your last cannon.
