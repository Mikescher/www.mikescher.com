###Gameplay tips & tricks

When two equal players shoot at a neutral cannon the first hit will decide the win because the cannons auto-regeneration will help him out.

Neutral cannons try (badly) to defend themselve, try to use that to your advantage.

Your cannons do have a maximum shooting speed, it may be more wisely to spread your power onto multiple cannons.

Be aware that your own bullets bounce from each other, fights can become really messy that way.

Slow down the speed in critical moments.

There are different kinds of wall, some destroy your bullets and some just reflect them, this ciuld be a strategical advantage.
