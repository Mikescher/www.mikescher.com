Perhaps I'm making too much Mini-Games, but hey .... here is another one:

I proudly present you [Borderline Defense](/programs/view/Borderline%20Defense). Borderline Defense is a funny little Space-Invaders-Clone and the final project of 2 years Delphi-AG.
Programmed (and designed) from the members of the Delphi-AG and the two leaders (Benjamin and myself) has it grown into a playable and quite funny game.
The background work is done by my [absCanvas](/programs/view/AbsCanvas)-Engine and the Special features are:

 - Endless Gameplay (as long as you can last)
 - An Online-Highscore
 - A Boss Fight at stage 20 (and 40, 60, 80 etc )
 - And a ship with 10 different upgrade levels

So, thats it ... have fun
Mike
