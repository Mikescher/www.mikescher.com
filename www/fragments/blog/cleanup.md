Yesterday I decided that a lot of my website is out of date and I should probably re-evaluate whats on here.  
To be short: I completely removed the fun-page, most links were netherless broken and the rest didn't really fit this page.
Also I re-did the Downlaodpage, you can now see 

 - absCanvas-Links
 - Versionnumbers
 - The sourcecode from a few programs
 - Sort by Date
 - The last added program on the mainpage

and a lot more.

Also I improved my Adminpage, hopefully I can now more easily upload and change programs/logs.

Finally I have an PSA for you: While writing my PHP-Code i found a pretty cool Editor (previously I used Notepad++):  
[Weaverslave 4](http://www.weaverslave.ws/)


You all a good day
