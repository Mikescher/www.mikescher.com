This one was relaxing. You can simple iterate through all 8100 cases and test each one in short time.  
Three notable things:

- You can test two fraction `a/b` and `c/d` simple of equality with the formula `a*d == b*c`.
- This is my compact [GCD algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) in befunge (stack -> stack)
- This is one of the few *real* Befunge-93 programs in this series. (It doesn't violate the [80x25](https://github.com/catseye/Befunge-93/blob/master/doc/Befunge-93.markdown) size rule)
