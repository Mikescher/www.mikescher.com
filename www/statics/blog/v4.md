When you see this Log you probably notice that this site looks a whole lot different than a few days before.  
And you you can probably guess it **I rewrote this website completely from scratch**.  
Finally there is a *real* PHP Framework behind this all ([Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com/) with [Yiistrap](http://www.getyiistrap.com/)) and my code looks kinda good and is [version controlled](https://github.com/Mikescher/www.mikescher.de).  

My hopes are that I can now easier add new programs and that the whole page looks a bit more professional.  
If you want to see how this page has evolved over the years - here are the thumbnails of mikescher.de version `1`, `2`, `3` and the current `4`:

![version 1](/data/images/log/ms_de_v1.jpg)
![version 2](/data/images/log/ms_de_v2.jpg)
![version 3](/data/images/log/ms_de_v3.jpg)
![version 4](/data/images/log/ms_de_v4.jpg)

Also look at the new [Blog section](/blog), for now there is not much content but perhaps that will change over te next few months.
