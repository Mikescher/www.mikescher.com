Okay, okay, after a loooong time I will write something in the log.  
In the last few months there wasn't much on this site, but be sure mikescher.de is not *(yet)* dead.  
I just have a lot to do with my abi and beside that I'm working on our Clan-homepage [SemteX](http://www.semtex.org).  

But I also wrote a few programs and I want to upload one which has gotten quite a bit of progress and is nearly finished: [Infinity Tournament](/programs/view/Infinity%20Tournament) 1.2.  
It's based on an old game by me, but writte completely frokm scratch new in my on 2D-Canvas Engine ([absCanvas](/programs/view/AbsCanvas)) ... have fun
