A lot of you probably have seen [various](/programs/view/BefunUtils) [befunge](/programs/view/BefunUtils) [stuff](https://github.com/Mikescher/BefunUtils) on this site.

But a thing I do now for a while is solving the **[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)** problems in befunge.  
To celebrate fifty solved levels I want to rally you again to my **[blogpost about this project](/blog/1/Project_Euler_with_Befunge)** and the [table](/blog/1/Project_Euler_with_Befunge) with all my solved problems.

Have a look and perhaps feel inspired to do a few problems by your self - most of them are quite fun and challenging.
