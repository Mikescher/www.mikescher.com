I don't think many of you know [rapla](https://code.google.com/p/rapla/). And you should probably be thankful about that. But if you happen to study at the DHBW-KA, or any other place that uses rapla you could be interested in my enhancement-script.

Rapla is a Resource scheduling and event planing software (mostly used for timetables), and my rapscript enhances the *(not very good)* online view.

It contains the following features:

 - Highlight courses you participate in
 - Highlight special events (free days, etc. ^_^)
 - Cleaner style
 - Highlight current day
 - Highlight current hour
 - Show horizontal time marker, that moves in realtime (the red line)
 - Show on weekends (saturday / sunday) the next week insted of the current

The script works on [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Google Chrome and can be downloaded from this Gist:
