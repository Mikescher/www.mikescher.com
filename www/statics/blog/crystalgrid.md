The same procedure as last program ?  
The same procedureas **every** program.

You see nothing really different, i wrote a little game in my spare free time. And now I'm uploading it.  
It's a little game named [Crystal Grid](/programs/view/Crystal%20Grid). Im pretty proud of the difficulty. It's pretty forgiving as long as you play on `Beginner` but extremely challenging on `Impossible`.

If you dare (and like) you can try beat my highscore
