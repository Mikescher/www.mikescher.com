Advent of Code 2019 is over, but just for fun I will try my hand at the 2017 problems.  
I'm mostly interested how python - a more common language for these kind of scripting problems - will perform.

I'm not really in a hurry so this could take some time until I'm finished (definitely more than 25 day...)
