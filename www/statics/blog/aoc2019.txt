This year I will try to solve the challenges with typescript. Originally I wanted to use Befunge, but the problems don't really work that well in Befunge.
Especially big input files are annoying to realize without I/O functions...

This is my first real encounter with typescript (or javascript that's more than small scripts) so the resulting code should be ... suboptimal.
But I hope I will improve :D
