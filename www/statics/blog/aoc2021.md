This year I don't have too much free time. So I won't use a completely new language but one which I'm currently using in my dayjob: golang.

I'm not the biggest fan of go (I think it's ok, but could really make with more convenience features), but I'm pretty experienced in it and can hopefully work a bit faster through the problems whis year.
