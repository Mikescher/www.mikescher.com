HÂ²O-Reaction is a little bigger project i did in the last few months.

Your target is to create chain reaction in a grid of water-molecules, the bigger and longer this reaction is - the more points you will get.
You can compare your personal highscore in an online leaderboard with already many players in it

Just click on a molecule of your choice and watch the resulting reaction, have fun.
