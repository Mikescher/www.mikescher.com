Borderline Defense is the final project of the java AG 2012 from the OKEN Gymnasium.  
The java AG is a little student project group by [Benjamin Rottler](http://benjaminrottler.de/) and myself.

Most of the code and all of the graphics were created by the students. They settled on the idea of creating a space invaders clone with a few unique features.  
Because we didn't wanted to get too much into optimizations and smaller problems we use my pre-existing game engine [absCanvas](/programs/view/absCanvas).

Borderline Defense shows it strengths in:

- 20 different designed levels and 10 different upgrade stages for your ship
- An endless gameplay wich gets harder and harder with time.
- An competitive online highscore where you can compare yourself with many others
