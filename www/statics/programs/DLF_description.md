And here is another fairly big project from me.  
A long time ago I had the idea of a program in which two computer programs play against each other. The two opponents get controlled by two dll's in which their KI is written.

Now I finally have written this program, you can create your own KI in delphi (or theoretical in every language that can create dll's) and let it fight against others.

For a detailed description how it works look at the included help-program.
